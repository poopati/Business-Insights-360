**Problem Statement :**  

**Atliq Hardwares**, a consumer electronics company with operations across multiple countries, is experiencing rapid business growth. Despite this expansion, the company continues to rely on Excel files for data storage and analysis. This approach poses significant challenges in terms of data accessibility, manipulation, and visualization. Recognizing the need for a more robust solution, the company's senior executives have decided to invest in a data analytics project and have assigned a dedicated team to address this issue.

**ðŸŒŸ Solution :**  

As a Data Analyst, I analyzed data from various sources and developed four dedicated dashboards tailored to the needs of each department: **Sales**ðŸ’µ, **Marketing**ðŸ“£, **Finance**ðŸ’°, and **Supply Chain**ðŸšš. Each dashboard highlights the relevant **KPIs** for its respective department, such as **net sales**, **gross margin**, **net profit**, **market share**, **top/bottom customers**, **top/bottom products**, **net error**, and **forecast accuracy**.  

Additionally, I created an **Executive Dashboard** that consolidates key metrics from all departments, offering a comprehensive and holistic view of the companyâ€™s overall performance. This approach ensures that every team has actionable insights specific to their goals while providing senior leadership with the information they need to drive strategic decisions.
